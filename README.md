# Devops-project
Created and deployed a running instance of a web server using chef configuration management tool . The web server serves hello world application.Secured the  application and hosted such that only appropriate ports are publicly exposed and any http requests are redirected to https. Automated this through chef. Iâ€™ve used self-signed certificate for the web server.
